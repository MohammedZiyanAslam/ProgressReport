Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created 10 options in pong game and gave the user a chance to chose them ans play the game

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have few errors to fix apart from that I have pretty much completed it

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Initially I planned for making an android app in java but the extensions in visual studio code for java didn't seem to work properly or may be my code had too many errors. Then I tried downloading eclipse and JDK which didn't work properly because my laptop is 32-bit but that software needs a 64-bit version to run :( 
In my new pong project I encountered few problems like creating those options and adjusting the speed of the paddle to create the impossible mode, but still when it's AI vs AI one of the side still losses. What I wanted was the ball to keep bouncing between the paddles and no side to score. Still after fixing the paddle speed one of the side controlled by the computer still looses.
